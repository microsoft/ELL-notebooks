Second, it downloads the code from the local `pi3` directory to the directory on the Pi specified by `rpipath`. Next, it builds the CMake project on the Pi. (Again, this is only necessary once per model.) Finally, it runs the cell's Python code on the Pi. Any output that the Python code prints will be shown in the notebook. Also, because the Python code could contain a loop, we provide a button to allow you to stop the code running on the Pi.\n",
